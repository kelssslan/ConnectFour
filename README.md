Course: COMP 3200 Algorithmic Techniques for Artificial Intelligence
Topics: Game Theory
Professor: Dr. David Churchill https://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/

A special thanks to Dr.Churchill for implementing a fun and great way to learn path searching methods. And also for giving me permission to share my experience with these assignments. Dr.Churchill spent months programming these assignments and the source codes are not available. The interface and testings were done by Dr.Churchill. Please sent me an email klan@mun.ca if you have any questions!

In this assignment, students were required to implement min-max trees to look ahead and evaluate the game board for the computer players.Students were also challenged to shorten their codes for the min-max trees.
